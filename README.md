The goal of the project is to give a brief text/image introduction to the Basque Country.
I divided the slides into two equal parts to show text information as well as visuals.

I used gimp to create animated gif(refresh page to see animation) on the first slide to show the different regions.
The slider and the index page came from jssor slider @ ```http://www.jssor.com/download.html```
The quiz is from lickQuiz ```https://github.com/jewlofthelotus/SlickQuiz```
Quiz content is constructed with Json.
